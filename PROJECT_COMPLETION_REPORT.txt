   - PASSES = 15 (easily adjustable)
   
   cluster.py:
   - N_CLUSTERS = 8 (easily adjustable)
   - MAX_FEATURES = 5000 (easily adjustable)

✓ 4. MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUTS
   All results saved as CSV in data/ folder:
   
   - cleaned_news.csv (preprocessed text)
   - document_topics.csv (documents with dominant topics)
   - news_with_clusters.csv (documents with cluster assignments)
   - final_results.csv (comprehensive results with all attributes)

✓ 5. PROJECT METADATA FILES
   - requirements.txt (all dependencies listed)
   - README.md (comprehensive technical documentation)

✓ 6. FINAL RUN ORDER CONFIRMATION
   Complete pipeline verified working:
   1. python scripts/preprocess.py ✓
   2. python scripts/topic_model.py ✓
   3. python scripts/cluster.py ✓
