**Relevance Explanation:** This paper is highly relevant as it provides an exhaustive survey of **web document clustering**, classifying approaches into text-based, link-based, and hybrid categories. It specifically addresses the use of cluster analysis as a form of **unsupervised classification** to discover hidden similarities and relationships within the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the Web.
**Key Contributions:**
*   Established a comprehensive **taxonomy of web clustering** based on document attributes: text-based (content), link-based (structure), and hybrid (combined).
*   Provided a thorough **comparative analysis of clustering algorithms** (e.g., K-means, HAC, Graph-based) focusing on quality-complexity tradeoffs and open research issues like incrementality and cluster labeling.

**Relevance Explanation:** This review is relevant to **unsupervised learning and text mining**, offering a detailed overview of traditional to heuristic-oriented document clustering methods. It distinguishes document clustering as a subset of data mining that groups similar documents together to facilitate navigation and information retrieval.
**Key Contributions:**
*   Detailed the **standard document clustering procedure**, including feature extraction (TF-IDF), document representation (Vector Space Model), and clustering execution.
*   Conducted an **experimental comparison** of partitioning methods (K-means) and hierarchical techniques (UPGMA), concluding that partitioning is better suited for large datasets due to linear complexity, while hierarchical methods offer better quality for smaller sets.

**Relevance Explanation:** This paper focuses on **unsupervised categorization of web documents**, specifically targeting the challenge of high-dimensional feature spaces where traditional algorithms often falter. It introduces novel partitioning techniques that do not require pre-specified distance functions, making it highly relevant to **advanced document clustering**.
**Key Contributions:**
*   Introduced two new algorithms for high-dimensional web data: **Association Rule Hypergraph Partitioning (ARHP)** and **Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP)**.
*   Demonstrated through experiments on real web data that these **partitioning-based methods scale linearly** and outperform standard distance-based or Bayesian techniques in high-dimensional settings.
